# Migration to v0.6.0

0.6.0 includes some breaking changes with its multi-entrypoint support. Here’s a guide on either how to migrate, or keep
your current setup working where possible.

## Output root entrypoint to `dist`

pkg-lib now defaults to putting your bundled outputs into the root package directory. If you want to revert this,
set `cjsOut` to `dist/[entrypoint].js` and `esmOut` to `dist/[entrypoint].mjs` (If you were outputting to another
directory previously, use that instead).

If you are using `main` and `module` in your `package.json`

Note, if you decide to start using multiple entrypoints you will want to change this back to the default so that users
can import the files directly (otherwise they have to `import "package/dist/entrypoint"` to reference it)

## Libraries with different CommonJS and ESModule output names

If you were using different names for your CommonJS and ESModule output files (e.g. `cjs.js` and `esm.mjs`), this is no
longer possible. You will need to figure out a new name, and set it in `mainEntryOut` (or use the default `index` name).

## Disable entrypoints

If you don’t have any entrypoints other than the main one, you can tell pkg-lib to not check for any by
setting `entrypoints` to an empty array in the config.
